Welcome to AbstractForm
---------------------

AbstractForm is a framework to build graphical forms for different GUI APIs for Java. With AbstractForm you can define a form
in different ways and render it to different GUI APIs.

Why AbstractForm?
-----------------

When you are designing the requirements of a business application, one of the decisions you need to make is which graphical 
user interface you are going to use. You must decide if your application will be web based application or will have a graphical
client and, in most cases, which framework will you use to the graphical interface (Swing, SWT, Vaadin, GWT, Web Based Templates, 
etc.). And most of the times you need to implement the same forms with more than one of them.

Then, Why do you need to write similar code to make forms with, for example, SWT and Vaadin? AbstractForm is a framework that prevent 
this situations making a generic definition of the forms and decouplig the renderization and binding of the form from the framework
that you use.
